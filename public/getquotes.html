            <p class="reasons" style="margin-top:10px; padding:10px;">
                You might think this is obvious if you're reading confusing articles about scientific studies, but this is even true if you're just reading for fun! Reading can act as a workout for your brain. When reading, readers have to recall characters, follow the plot, and comprhend what is happening in the story. Every time you read a book, you're exercising your brain to improve your memory.

            <p class="reasons" style="margin-top:10px; padding:10px;">
                Reading can help you better understand any subject you are willing to learn about, and along the way, gives you a wider range of vocabulary. Furthermore, not only does reading increase your vocabulary, it also enhances your creativity and imagination! Not kidding! Creativity is useful for thinking of solutions to problems, and leads to success.

            <p class="reasons" style="margin-top:10px; padding:10px;">
                When you read, you likely feel like you live in the story, by walking in the character's shoes. Reading lets you take on new perspectives, and can make you open-minded to new ideas. It is also proven to be true that reading can increase how empathetic you are! Empathy is a great trait to have.

                Did you know reading burns calories? In fact, reading burns 50% more calories than watching TV for the same length of time. A study conducted by students in Yale even showed that reading habits affect your longevity! People who read lived on average 23 months longer than those who didn't. Next time, instead of watching TV, pick up a book.

If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief. –Franz Kafka', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote', 'Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind. -Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote'];
