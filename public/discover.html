                What is fair justice? Books teach us about life by telling a story, with imagination and truths. They teach us about ourselves, the good parts, and bad parts too. Even though the books were written a long time ago, people still value the same traits, such as kindness, honesty and mercy. The Count of Monte Cristo and Les Miserables, are both timeless classics. The Count of Monte Cristo is about a man named Edmond Dantes who escapes from prison to seek revenge. Edmond Dantes finds that Danglars, Villefort, and Fernand, who framed him as a Bonapartist have become rich, and Morrel, who tried to help him the most, is about to be bankrupt. He decides to make sure everyone gets what he thinks they deserve. Les Miserables is about Jean Valjean, who was imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread. After a kind bishop’s act of pity, Jean Valjean is determined to start fresh, and be an honest man, but Javert, a police spy who knows who he is, seeks to enforce what he thinks is justice. They might seem like very different books, but they have many similarities. <br> The main characters are very similar. They both persevere. In The Count of Monte Cristo, Dantes thinks of a new plan to escape, even after his friend in Château d'If dies, and Jean keeps helping others, even though his identity is revealed one time and he risks getting caught by Javert each time. But both stories show that perseverance is important, it will never be useless to keep trying. The characters are also both selfless, because Edmond Dantes decides to wait for Abbe Faria to get better and escape together, even though he has an opportunity to escape by himself, and Faria has told Dantes that he is unlikely to ever recover. Jean who was pretending to be M. Madeleine helps the man(Fauchelevent) trapped under the cart even though Javert suspects he is Jean Valjean the convict and if Jean lifts the cart off of him, it confirms his suspicions. Fauchelevent was not Jean’s friend at the time, he was jealous that Jean was a simple workman who became rich, while he had become bankrupt. Edmond and Jean are similar in the ways that they are a benefactor to someone in need, Jean takes Cosette from the Thenardiers, and Edmond, calling himself Sinbad the Sailor, helps Monsieur Morrel out of debt, saving his life. <br> People can change. Both characters change a lot, from the beginning to the end of the story. Edmond Dantes began as a very content and well-liked character and then he became bent on vengeance on those who ruined his life. Jean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s seven children, then spent 19 years in prison for it. This makes others judge him, because he is an ex-convict with a yellow passport, and he is tormented by his past until the compassionate bishop gifts him silverware and candlesticks, to start a new life. <br> Edmond and Jean are also powered by strong motivations, because Edmond Dantes, being framed by Danglars and Fernard, and also by Villefort, staying in prison for 14 years until he escaped, and discovering that Mercedes married Fernand, had a good reason for his want of revenge. Jean Valjean tried to help Cosette as much as he could, since he promised Fantine to find her child and pay her debts to the Thenardiers. Also, he was inspired by the bishop to be honest and good. <br> There are many coincidences in both books. In Les Miserables, it was very fortunate that Jean went to the town, where the Bishop was, and met the “good woman” when he was about to sleep on the stone bench. It was a happenstance in The Count of Monte Cristo that the letter was from Villefort’s father, Noirtier, and Villefort was the one questioning him. Also, it was pure luck that the man Jean Valjean went up to in the garden was the very same old Fauchelevent, who recognized Jean as Father Madeleine. Both stories would have played out very differently, if not for these events. <br>Both books are written in third person point of view, and have multiple perspectives, such as Villefort, Maximilian, and Franz in The Count of Monte Cristo and Fantine, Cosette, and Fauchelevent in Les Miserables. They also both were set in the 19th century, in parts of Europe. <br> There are some differences, however. Edmond Dantes did not commit any crimes, in the beginning, and Jean Valjean did steal the bread, and attempt to escape from prison multiple times, although the punishment was outrageous and unjust, in my opinion. They are also opposites, in their past. Edmond Dantes had a perfect life, even though he was not extremely rich, he was happy, about to marry Mercedes, and become a captain of a ship, the Pharaon. Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family, and he worked hard to support his sister, as she had brought him up. The characters can have a different background, yet be alike each other.<br> They are captivating and very classic books. They bring extraordinary stories to life, and teach important lessons, to appreciate life and have hope, to dedicate yourself to make the world a better place. We live on, even if times are hard. I couldn’t ever say one book is better than the other, because they were written with different purposes, and every story is unique. <br> *Note that the abridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo is somewhat different from the original book </p>

                <strong>Characters</strong><br>Cassandra Clare writes her characters so vividly that you can almost see them. She takes the cliche of ‘evil person trying to take over the world’, and ‘a teenager discovering that their life is a lie’ and transforms it into something unique and unexpected. The protagonists are likable and funny, and the antagonist is multi-faceted and interesting. Clary is average and not perfect, which is why you can empathize with her. She is also brave and not arrogant at all, unlike some main characters in YA. All the characters have their own history, and the cast of characters is very diverse. The foundation of this book are the characters.<br><strong>Plot</strong><br>The story starts with a 15 year old girl named Clary Fray, who discovers that demons are real and she’s one of the Shadowhunters, the ones who protect the human world from them. She finds out her mother had hidden this from her, but before she can confront her, her mother is kidnapped. Clary has to rely on a group of Shadowhunters to get her back, and is pulled into a world full of warlocks, fae, werewolves, and vampires. This is just the beginning. Her best friend gets turned into a rat somewhere in the book, she finds out her memories got erased, and that an old friend of her mother’s, Luke, is a werewolf. <br>There’s plenty of action, mystery, coming-of-age, and everything. A lot of things happen. There are a lot of twists and turns and cliffhangers. And be prepared to read the rest of the series if you hate cliffhangers. This is not a spoiler. But if you often get lost in books with complicated plots, you probably shouldn’t read this book.<br><strong>Worldbuilding</strong><br>This is one of the best examples of worldbuilding I’ve read! This imaginary world where supernatural beings coexist with humans, only normal humans cannot see them, might sound like a cliche beginning again, but when Cassandra Clare wrote it, it’s modern and believable. There are no loopholes, or things left unexplained. Even better, Cassandra Clare embeds the explanation without leaving you bored or feeling stuffed with unnecessary details that you forget in an instant. The world this story takes place in is modern-day New York, except with magic. <br> <strong>Author's Style</strong>A<br>The writing is excellent! The description is very fitting to the story, and the best thing is, you can imagine the story in your head. Cassandra Clare is so good at making the story flow, without having places that just don’t make sense or places where the writing seems to get stuck. The book is fast-paced, and nothing is ever boring. This book is aimed at 9-12 grade students, except the reading level is only 3-5. This is one of the reasons I give this book 4 stars for Author’s Style. The other reason is the dialogue. The dialogue is really amusing, but some of it is unrealistic, since there are sentences so honest, perceptive, and open that no one I’ve ever met would actually say that. <br> <strong>Perspective</strong><br>Although it’s great that the story is told in multiple perspectives, the author doesn’t make it clear who is the narrator; because it’s all in third person and sometimes perspectives change by chapters, sometimes pages, and you just have to guess.<br><strong>Additional Notes</strong><br>This book is very, very, similar to the Harry Potter series. Will I read the next book? … I think I will. <br> <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Read this book if you enjoyed the Harry Potter series, and if you like books that are action from beginning to end. The best parts of the book are the worldbuilding and characters. Don’t read this book if you get confused reading books with complicated plots. Also, if you are looking for a short read, you might not want to read it. Or, just start reading and don’t let my words change your mind.<hr>
